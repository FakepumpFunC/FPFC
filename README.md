# Solana Pixel Trader

A retro-style pixel art trading simulator for Solana tokens with real-time price data.

## üéÆ Project Overview

Solana Pixel Trader (also known as "Pixel Pump Arcade") is a browser-based game that allows users to:

- Enter Solana token contract addresses
- View simulated price charts for those tokens
- Practice trading with virtual SOL
- Track performance and trading history

The application features a nostalgic pixel-art UI with retro gaming aesthetics, using the "Press Start 2P" font and pixel-perfect design elements.

## üìã Features

- **Token Loading**: Enter a Solana contract address to load token data
- **Simulated Trading**: Practice buying and selling with virtual SOL
- **Pixel Art Interface**: Enjoy a retro gaming aesthetic
- **Performance Tracking**: View your trading history and results (coming soon)
- **Settings Customization**: Adjust game parameters (coming soon)

## üé® Pixel Art Implementation

The application features a stylized pixel art cityscape background:

- **Gradient Sunset Sky**: A vibrant gradient from deep purple to bright orange creates a sunset effect
- **Building Silhouettes**: Vector-based city skyline silhouettes create depth at the bottom of the screen
- **Window Lights**: Yellow/orange pixel lights in buildings provide a nighttime city feel
- **Semi-transparent Elements**: Main content container uses transparency and backdrop blur for a modern retro look

The background is implemented using fixed positioning to create a non-scrolling backdrop while allowing the main content to scroll independently, ensuring proper display on various device sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite
- **UI Components**: Custom CSS with pixel art styling
- **Icons**: Heroicons
- **Font**: "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts

## Features

### Real-time Price Data
- **Ave.ai Integration**: Integrated with Ave.ai API for real-time USD price data
- **Chart Price Synchronization**: Displays price data from GMGN charts for consistent display
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling when external APIs are unavailable

### Trading Page
- **Live Price Display**: Shows current token price with change indicators
- **Interactive Chart**: Embedded GMGN chart for technical analysis
- **Buy/Sell Interface**: Simulated trading interface with pixel art styling

## Chart Price Sync Implementation

The TradingPage features price synchronization between the header display and the embedded GMGN chart:

1. **Price Source Indicator**: Shows whether price data is from API or chart
2. **Sync Status**: Visual indicator showing when prices were last synchronized
3. **Fallback System**: If API prices cannot be fetched, chart prices are used instead

### Technical Implementation

Due to cross-origin restrictions that prevent direct access to iframe content:

- **Simulated Chart Data**: For development, we use a simulation that generates prices consistent with the chart
- **Periodic Sync**: Price data is refreshed every 5 seconds to stay consistent with chart
- **Visual Feedback**: Users can see when prices were last synced from the chart

In a production environment, this would be enhanced with:
- Direct API access to GMGN's price data
- Server-side proxy for secure API key handling
- WebSocket implementation for real-time updates

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the trading page by navigating to `/trading/{contractAddress}` where `contractAddress` is any valid Solana token address.

## Styling

All components use pixel art styling for a retro gaming aesthetic, with responsive design for all device sizes.

## üîë Solana Wallet Connection (NEW)
